# walrus operator := 
    # new to python 3.8
    # assignment expression aka walrus operator
    # assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression

# happy = True
# print(happy)

# print(happy := True) walrus operator prints the exact same as above.

# foods = list()
# while True:
#     food = input("What type of food do you like?: ")
#     if food == "quit":
#         break
#     foods.append(food)


foods = list()
while food := input("What type of food do you like?: ") != "quit":
    foods.append()

# same output as the long line of code above.
