#variable = a container for a value. Behaves as the value that it contains.

#you can use print(type(variable)) to check the type of variable

name = "Ashleigh"
#print("Hello " + name)

#if you want to create a long name variable use underscore instead of space as follows

first_name = "Ashleigh"
last_name = "Simpson"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

age = 23

#to print an int with a string you must convert the int to a string using str(variable/integer)

#print("Your age is: "+str(age))
 
#type casting = convert the data type of a value to another data type

# y = 1 #int
# x = 2.0 #float
#z = "3" #string

# print("X is "+str(x))
# print("Y is "+str(y))
#print(z*3)

#you can give variables the same value with a far less complex code instead of
#x = 5
#y = 5
#z = 5
# you can use
# x, y, z = 5, 5, 5 or x = y = z = 5 to apply the same value to multiple variables
